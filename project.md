${{ content_synopsis }} This image will run redis [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) and [distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md) for more security. Besides being more secure and slim than most images, it also offers additional start parameters to either start Redis in command mode, as a replica or as a in-memory database that persists nothing to disk. Simply provide the command needed:

# COMMANDS ðŸ“Ÿ
* **--cmd** - Will execute all commands against the Redis database specified via ```REDIS_HOST``` environment variable
* **--replica MASTER** - Will start as replica from MASTER (can be IP, FQDN or container DNS)
* **--in-memory** - Will start Redis only in memory
