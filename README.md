Run redis rootless, distroless and secure.

# INTRODUCTION üì¢

For developers, who are building real-time data-driven applications, Redis is the preferred, fastest, and most feature-rich cache, data structure server, and document and vector query engine.

![REDISINSIGHT](https://github.com/11notes/docker-redis/blob/master/img/RedisInsight.png?raw=true)

# SYNOPSIS üìñ
**What can I do with this?** This image will run redis [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) and [distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md) for more security. Besides being more secure and slim than most images, it also offers additional start parameters to either start Redis in command mode, as a replica or as a in-memory database that persists nothing to disk. Simply provide the command needed:

# COMMANDS üìü
* **--cmd** - Will execute all commands against the Redis database specified via ```REDIS_HOST``` environment variable
* **--replica MASTER** - Will start as replica from MASTER (can be IP, FQDN or container DNS)
* **--in-memory** - Will start Redis only in memory
* **[^1]** - ... and more?

# UNIQUE VALUE PROPOSITION üí∂
**Why should I run this image and not the other image(s) that already exist?** Good question! Because ...

> [!IMPORTANT]
>* ... this image runs [rootless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/rootless.md) as 1000:1000
>* ... this image has no shell since it is [distroless](https://github.com/11notes/RTFM/blob/main/linux/container/image/distroless.md)
>* ... this image is auto updated to the latest version via CI/CD
>* ... this image has a health check
>* ... this image runs read-only
>* ... this image is automatically scanned for CVEs before and after publishing
>* ... this image is created via a secure and pinned CI/CD process
>* ... this image is very small
>* ... this image can be used to execute commands after redis has started

If you value security, simplicity and optimizations to the extreme, then this image might be for you.

# MAIN TAGS üè∑Ô∏è
These are the main tags for the image. There is also a tag for each commit and its shorthand sha256 value.

* [7.4.5](https://hub.docker.com/r/11notes/redis/tags?name=7.4.5)

### There is no latest tag, what am I supposed to do about updates?
It is of my opinion that the ```:latest``` tag is dangerous. Many times, I‚Äôve introduced **breaking** changes to my images. This would have messed up everything for some people. If you don‚Äôt want to change the tag to the latest [semver](https://semver.org/), simply use the short versions of [semver](https://semver.org/). Instead of using ```:7.4.5``` you can use ```:7``` or ```:7.4```. Since on each new version these tags are updated to the latest version of the software, using them is identical to using ```:latest``` but at least fixed to a major or minor version.

If you still insist on having the bleeding edge release of this app, simply use the ```:rolling``` tag, but be warned! You will get the latest version of the app instantly, regardless of breaking changes or security issues or what so ever. You do this at your own risk!

# REGISTRIES ‚òÅÔ∏è

# PARENT IMAGE üèõÔ∏è
> [!IMPORTANT]
>This image is not based on another image but uses [scratch](https://hub.docker.com/_/scratch) as the starting layer.
>The image consists of the following distroless layers that were added:
>* [11notes/distroless](https://github.com/11notes/docker-distroless/blob/master/arch.dockerfile) - contains users, timezones and Root CA certificates

# BUILT WITH üß∞
* [redis/redis](https://github.com/redis/redis)

# GENERAL TIPS üìå
> [!TIP]
>* Use a reverse proxy like Traefik, Nginx, HAproxy to terminate TLS and to protect your endpoints
>* Use Let‚Äôs Encrypt DNS-01 challenge to obtain valid SSL certificates for your services

[^1]: Sentinel mode will follow soon as well as the possibility to change the announce IP and port
